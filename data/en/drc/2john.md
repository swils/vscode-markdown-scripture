# 2 John

## Chapter 1 <!-- scripture:1 -->

[1] The Ancient to the lady Elect and her children, whom I love in the truth: and not I only, but also all they that have known the truth,
[2] For the sake of the truth which dwelleth in us and shall be with us for ever.
[3] Grace be with you, mercy and peace from God the Father and from Christ Jesus the Son of the Father: in truth and charity.
[4] I was exceeding glad that I found of thy children walking in truth, as we have received a commandment from the Father.
[5] And now I beseech thee, lady, not as writing a new commandment to thee, but that which we have had from the beginning, that we love one another.
[6] And this is charity: That we walk according to his commandments. For this is the commandment that, as you have heard from the beginning, you should walk in the same:
[7] For many seducers are gone out into the world who confess not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh. This is a seducer and an antichrist.
[8] Look to yourselves, that you lose not the things which you have wrought: but that you may receive a full reward.
[9] Whosoever revolteth and continueth not in the doctrine of Christ hath not God. He that continueth in the doctrine, the same hath both the Father and the Son.
[10] If any man come to you and bring not this doctrine, receive him not into the house nor say to him: God speed you.
[11] For he that saith unto him: God speed you, communicateth with his wicked works.
[12] Having more things to write unto you, I would not by paper and ink: for I hope that I shall be with you and speak face to face, that your joy may be full.
[13] The children of thy sister Elect salute thee.
